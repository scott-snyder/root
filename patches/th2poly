Add TH2Poly::FindFixBin.

For most TH* classes, FindFixBin acts as a const variant of FindBin.
However, TH2Poly overrides FindBin with quite different semantics but
does not also override FindFixBin.  Thus, calling TH2Poly::FindFixBin
does something unexpected and quite likely wrong.

Clean up by renaming TH2Poly::FindBin to TH2Poly::FindFixBin (since it doesn't
actually do anything non-const) and add TH2Poly::FindBin forwarding to it.
