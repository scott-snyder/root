Fix problem building with gcc11.

gcc11 uses the no_unique_address attribute in its implementation of std::tuple
(which is then used by std::unique_ptr).  However, it spells it
__no_unique_address__, which cling doesn't recognized.  This can result
in having differing memory layouts for structures in compiled code versus
cling, which can give mysterious failures.

Patch cling to recognize __no_unique_address__ as a synonym
for no_unique_address.

See issue #8071.
